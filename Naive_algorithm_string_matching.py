  you're telling the program to test that condition,and trigger an error

    In Python, it's roughly equivalent to this:

if not condition:

    Pythonâ€™s assert statement is a debugging aid, not a mechanism for
    handling run-time errors(try&catch)
    asserts are useful to check conditions that should be true in a
